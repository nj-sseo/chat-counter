2018-04-10 12:08:41,"이준섭","I dont want to risk getting an absence T.T so sorry to tell you late"
2018-04-10 12:09:10,"남재창","Ok, got it. Marked as tardy"
2018-04-10 12:09:28,"이준섭","Thank you so much ^.^"
2018-04-10 13:41:45,"남재창","After the today's class, one of students discussed about his HW score. If you think you are the guy, please send me an email."
2018-04-11 20:09:11,"정진혁","Professor I have a question from the last lab! I changed my branch to ReuseLoop and committed the changes. I see that I pushed a branch named ReuseLoop in Github. Do I have to change my branch to master?"
2018-04-11 20:24:03,"한상민","It is also curious to me"
2018-04-11 20:31:20,"남재창","You can't change your ReuseLoop branch into master but you can merge it if you like your current change. If you don't like the ReuseLoop brach, you can delete it. Do you want to learn how to merge?"
2018-04-11 20:32:11,"정진혁","Oh then why can't I change my branch?"
2018-04-11 20:32:32,"남재창","which branch?"
2018-04-11 20:32:36,"남재창","in where?"
2018-04-11 20:32:53,"정진혁","In eclipse!"
2018-04-11 20:33:41,"남재창","Do you want to switch your branch from ReuseLoop to master?"
2018-04-11 20:36:06,"정진혁","Um.. I am curious about the differenece between pushing with ReuseLoop and with master."
2018-04-11 20:38:00,"남재창","You can just keep two source code in git. You can unlimited variations of your program. You can implement experimental features of your program and if you like it you can merge the branch with master. In this way, your program can be improved. This is how developers work with git branches."
2018-04-11 20:38:59,"남재창","multiples developers work for different features in different branches and then we can merge all the branches so that we can complete our program together."
2018-04-11 20:44:07,"정진혁","Oh, so programmers can make their own branches which are like copies of the source code. When they modify the code and commit changes with the branches, the code editor decides whether to merge or not. And if we work with the master branch and commit the changes, there is no need to merge because it is the master branch."
2018-04-11 20:44:51,"정진혁","Do I understand correctly?"
2018-04-11 20:45:23,"남재창","Yes."
2018-04-11 20:46:01,"정진혁","Oh I get it! Thank you so much, sir!"
2018-04-11 20:46:36,"남재창","You may read this article. http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"
2018-04-11 21:44:47,"정진혁","Oh good source to read! Thanks professor:)"

2018-04-11 22:34:54,"조정훈","when I run the code, I cannot enter the name on console  "

2018-04-11 22:35:34,"조정훈","Like this... Help me~~~"
2018-04-11 22:37:29,"영인","You need to put println instead of print"
2018-04-11 22:41:17,"조정훈","Photo"
2018-04-11 22:41:35,"김수현","Or write one more that line like getchar() in C"
2018-04-11 22:41:36,"조정훈","I put println....but it's same...."
2018-04-11 22:44:33,"조정훈","getchar()?? How?? can you explain more?"
2018-04-11 22:45:43,"윤종욱","I think this code has no problem ... "
2018-04-11 22:48:41,"조정훈","I think so too.......(훌쩍)"
2018-04-11 22:48:44,"김수현","Maybe you pressed enter(=input '₩n') because of setting the size of array. but nextline() reacts '₩n' so it was skipped"
2018-04-11 22:49:36,"영인","Make 3 Scanner instances might solve problem"
2018-04-11 22:49:42,"김수현","If you write that line one more, it will be solved."
2018-04-11 22:50:23,"조정훈","Oh!! I got it"
2018-04-11 22:51:27,"조정훈","Photo"
2018-04-11 22:51:42,"조정훈","Thank you very very much 영인 수현 and 종욱!!"
2018-04-11 23:02:08,"남재창","Good discussion. Thanks all!"
2018-04-11 23:14:39,"조정훈","good night(하하)"
2018-04-13 09:33:09,"한상민","home..."
2018-04-13 09:37:25,"이준섭","Is the exam going to be usually from what we did in the lab and homework?"
2018-04-13 10:35:30,"이준섭","Is it a must to provide both int (key) and string if we call Hashmap<integer,String> or will it get a default key?"
2018-04-13 10:36:54,"이준섭","Yes I am clear ^^"
