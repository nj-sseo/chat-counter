If your HW1-3 is mess becuase of git, github, and gradle, then back up only your code and start HW1-3 from the scratch by initiating git,github, gradle by following the slides. That could be easier and you can save your precious time."

I did it.
But when i imported my project, there was no creation.
I can’t commit HW1-4.
I made a remote repository with name of Lab07 and also made same name directory in c:\git.
Did i miss something?"
2018-04-01 07:11:36,"남재창","Did you do Gradle init?"

2018-04-03 15:05:48,"윤종욱","JC, in Lab07, Prob3 has no sample run(console). Do I just print “I’m sorry, <<name>>. You failed this course”? or like your code? "

2018-04-03 22:35:18,"남재창","@종욱 just print “I’m sorry, <<name>>. You failed this course” For other parts,  you can follow the example code or other proper sentences."
2018-04-03 22:36:17,"남재창","@정훈 One javadoc has a package name in index.html. Then, click the package name and you will see two classes."
2018-04-03 22:36:31,"윤종욱","Thank you! "
2018-04-03 22:37:58,"남재창","For getter, you must return something and print it where it is called if necesary. Check getter examples from slides."

2018-04-04 23:49:26,"이준섭","Professor for prob3, can I use Math.random() or is it compulsary to use java.util.Random?"

2018-04-05 06:39:17,"남재창","Constructor is a kind of method."
2018-04-05 08:08:19,"정진혁","oh i was confused. thanks professor!!"

2018-04-05 11:23:03,"정진혁","Professor I got another question! How can I javadoc the constructor in the main class?"
2018-04-05 12:05:16,"남재창","You can define javadoc like method but thiere is no return type. In your example, you can define like public Main_YTC() {  …. }"
2018-04-05 12:09:50,"정진혁","right. I did define public Main_YTC. Then, can I leave the constructor description empty?"
2018-04-05 12:10:53,"남재창","If you do not have any statements in your contrcutor, do not define it."
2018-04-05 12:11:43,"남재창","You just need to take care of only constructors that have any statements and parameters. No need to add javadoc for the emepty default contrructor."
2018-04-05 12:15:54,"정진혁","oh I got it!! Thank you so much!!"

2018-04-05 20:28:09,"한상민","1.Do I must initialize in Java?
2.Why initialize this.variables, not class variables? Is it to hide variables declared in the Class?
3.Do I must use this.? and when?
I want to know more about this., getter and setter.
Help me!!!
"
2018-04-05 21:19:52,"남재창","1. what 'initilize' do you mean? "
2018-04-05 21:20:54,"남재창","2. this means 'this class'. So this.variables are actuall class-level variables (instance varialbes.)"
2018-04-05 21:21:22,"남재창","The reason using 'this' is to distinghish it with local varialbes. For example this.name = name."
2018-04-05 21:21:49,"남재창","local variable name is assigned to instance varialbe 'name'."
2018-04-05 21:22:59,"남재창","So, in case instance varialbe name is same as local variable, we must use 'this' for the instance variables in the same method."
2018-04-05 22:08:13,"한상민","1. I mean... Does initialization of variable is must done?   "
2018-04-05 22:08:27,"한상민","in Java?"
2018-04-05 22:14:13,"한상민","It is really hard to me. I think even if I do not use this., I can distinguish. Should we distinguish for ""whom""? for machine? for other user of class? "
2018-04-05 22:22:33,"남재창","1. to use a variable, we have to initialize it. The reason we define a variable is to hold some value. Initilization means assigning a value to a variable at very first."
2018-04-05 22:23:18,"이준섭","I think initializing is necessary for just every programming language just to be safe without errors but i mean of course you don't have to since its an option"
2018-04-05 22:24:46,"이준섭","if you are talking about the initial value for the empty constructor its because when you create an object without a parameter there should be a default value"
2018-04-05 22:24:51,"남재창","you don't need to use 'this.' in case instance variable name and local name is different. However, sometimes developers like to define the same names for both instance variable and local verable. For this reason, we may need to use ""this."" to distingiush instanve variable and local variable with same name."
2018-04-05 23:42:04,"한상민","@준섭, are you TA? Thank you! It is perfect answer for me.
@JC, thank you. Now I understand the availability of this. I thought I worked hard in class. But I should more concentrate. I will! Thank you. Have a good night:]"

2018-04-11 20:24:03,"한상민","It is also curious to me"
2018-04-11 20:31:20,"남재창","You can't change your ReuseLoop branch into master but you can merge it if you like your current change. If you don't like the ReuseLoop brach, you can delete it. Do you want to learn how to merge?"
2018-04-11 20:32:11,"정진혁","Oh then why can't I change my branch?"
2018-04-11 20:32:32,"남재창","which branch?"
2018-04-11 20:32:36,"남재창","in where?"
2018-04-11 20:32:53,"정진혁","In eclipse!"
2018-04-11 20:33:41,"남재창","Do you want to switch your branch from ReuseLoop to master?"
2018-04-11 20:36:06,"정진혁","Um.. I am curious about the differenece between pushing with ReuseLoop and with master."
2018-04-11 20:38:00,"남재창","You can just keep two source code in git. You can unlimited variations of your program. You can implement experimental features of your program and if you like it you can merge the branch with master. In this way, your program can be improved. This is how developers work with git branches."
2018-04-11 20:38:59,"남재창","multiples developers work for different features in different branches and then we can merge all the branches so that we can complete our program together."
2018-04-11 20:44:07,"정진혁","Oh, so programmers can make their own branches which are like copies of the source code. When they modify the code and commit changes with the branches, the code editor decides whether to merge or not. And if we work with the master branch and commit the changes, there is no need to merge because it is the master branch."
2018-04-11 20:44:51,"정진혁","Do I understand correctly?"
2018-04-11 20:45:23,"남재창","Yes."

2018-04-29 08:24:43,"남재창","Yes, I think so too. Private variables are created when we call super. But I'm not sure if two instances are created.

So you study abtract class in advance by doing prob3 or may solve other problems first. One of students suggested to provide detailed descriptions for each problem. Sorry for any inconvenience caused. But you can solve with creativity if you can get corret output. From HW2-2, detailed descriptions will be given but without candiate answer code. In additon, current code is not perfect in terms of namaing. You should fix all names if they are not following convetions. So be carefull and do not lose your mark becaseof that.

2018-05-18 19:41:26,"남재창","No, you must deal with all messages as the same data type. Otherwise, your code will be complicated."
2018-05-18 21:06:22,"남재창","there might be encoding issue when reading csv files in Windows. In that case, you need to set encoding for your Scanner. For example, new Scanner(file,""UTF-8"")"
