2018-04-03 21:15:44,"조정훈","JC, I create two javadocs for two classes in one package, but there is only one javadoc... where is another one?"
2018-04-03 22:34:17,"조정훈","Also, when defining getter method, should I 'return' something? Can I just print values?"
2018-04-03 22:35:18,"남재창","@종욱 just print “I’m sorry, <<name>>. You failed this course” For other parts,  you can follow the example code or other proper sentences."
2018-04-03 22:36:17,"남재창","@정훈 One javadoc has a package name in index.html. Then, click the package name and you will see two classes."
2018-04-03 22:36:31,"윤종욱","Thank you! "
2018-04-03 22:37:58,"남재창","For getter, you must return something and print it where it is called if necesary. Check getter examples from slides."
2018-04-03 22:38:47,"조정훈","okay thanks!"
2018-04-04 23:49:26,"이준섭","Professor for prob3, can I use Math.random() or is it compulsary to use java.util.Random?"
2018-04-04 23:57:32,"남재창","You can use any random method if your program generates correct output."
2018-04-04 23:57:49,"이준섭","Oh okay thank you ^.^"
2018-04-05 03:51:12,"정진혁","Professor, Is it okay not to write Javadoc for constructors?"
2018-04-05 06:39:17,"남재창","Constructor is a kind of method."
2018-04-05 08:08:19,"정진혁","oh i was confused. thanks professor!!"
2018-04-05 08:33:34,"남재창","No problem ;)"

2018-04-05 11:23:03,"정진혁","Professor I got another question! How can I javadoc the constructor in the main class?"
2018-04-05 12:05:16,"남재창","You can define javadoc like method but thiere is no return type. In your example, you can define like public Main_YTC() {  …. }"
2018-04-05 12:09:50,"정진혁","right. I did define public Main_YTC. Then, can I leave the constructor description empty?"
2018-04-05 12:10:53,"남재창","If you do not have any statements in your contrcutor, do not define it."
2018-04-05 12:11:43,"남재창","You just need to take care of only constructors that have any statements and parameters. No need to add javadoc for the emepty default contrructor."
2018-04-05 12:15:54,"정진혁","oh I got it!! Thank you so much!!"
2018-04-05 17:10:24,"심준석","Professor JC . When I was trying to check indentation , there is no change even if I click correct identation button"
2018-04-05 17:10:57,"이수현","이수현 left this chatroom."
2018-04-05 17:11:23,"심준석","*identation  -> indentaion"
2018-04-05 17:11:52,"심준석","How can I sovle this problem?"
2018-04-05 17:12:24,"권현우","then yours is already perfect"
2018-04-05 17:12:36,"권현우","no need to fix"
2018-04-05 17:16:08,"심준석","Thanks for answering!  Yes I know like that before, but professor gave me comment that I have to check indentation again"
2018-04-05 17:17:43,"권현우","that's right..."
2018-04-05 18:05:35,"남재창","Ctrl+ a and then Ctrl +i for the indetation."
2018-04-05 18:06:07,"남재창","심준석 try this. You will see indentation applies."
2018-04-05 18:11:38,"심준석","I did it and commit again .
Thanks for help professor!"

2018-04-05 20:28:09,"한상민","1.Do I must initialize in Java?
2.Why initialize this.variables, not class variables? Is it to hide variables declared in the Class?
3.Do I must use this.? and when?
I want to know more about this., getter and setter.
Help me!!!
"
2018-04-05 21:19:52,"남재창","1. what 'initilize' do you mean? "
2018-04-05 21:20:54,"남재창","2. this means 'this class'. So this.variables are actuall class-level variables (instance varialbes.)"
2018-04-05 21:21:22,"남재창","The reason using 'this' is to distinghish it with local varialbes. For example this.name = name."
2018-04-05 21:21:49,"남재창","local variable name is assigned to instance varialbe 'name'."
2018-04-05 21:22:59,"남재창","So, in case instance varialbe name is same as local variable, we must use 'this' for the instance variables in the same method."
2018-04-05 22:08:13,"한상민","1. I mean... Does initialization of variable is must done?   "
2018-04-05 22:08:27,"한상민","in Java?"
2018-04-05 22:14:13,"한상민","It is really hard to me. I think even if I do not use this., I can distinguish. Should we distinguish for ""whom""? for machine? for other user of class? "
2018-04-05 22:22:33,"남재창","1. to use a variable, we have to initialize it. The reason we define a variable is to hold some value. Initilization means assigning a value to a variable at very first."
2018-04-05 22:23:18,"이준섭","I think initializing is necessary for just every programming language just to be safe without errors but i mean of course you don't have to since its an option"
2018-04-05 22:24:46,"이준섭","if you are talking about the initial value for the empty constructor its because when you create an object without a parameter there should be a default value"
2018-04-05 22:24:51,"남재창","you don't need to use 'this.' in case instance variable name and local name is different. However, sometimes developers like to define the same names for both instance variable and local verable. For this reason, we may need to use ""this."" to distingiush instanve variable and local variable with same name."
2018-04-05 23:42:04,"한상민","@준섭, are you TA? Thank you! It is perfect answer for me.
@JC, thank you. Now I understand the availability of this. I thought I worked hard in class. But I should more concentrate. I will! Thank you. Have a good night:]"
2018-04-06 00:01:36,"남재창","준섭 is one of classmates taking this course. I'm happy because of you guys with active discussions. Hope other students learn something from this chat room. Cheers!"

2018-04-06 09:38:41,"한상민","Is there any thing, when I changed a method?"

2018-04-06 09:44:03,"권현우","Why do we use constructor?
Is it just for saving lines in the class where the main method is at?"
